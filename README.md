# Crime Analysis for Optimized Security Deployment in Los Angeles
This project presents a **data-driven Tableau dashboard** designed to help a hypothetical security guard company optimize deployment strategies across parking lots in Los Angeles. By analyzing public crime data, the dashboard highlights spatial and temporal crime patterns to support executive decisions on resource allocation and guard placement.

## Scenario
You are a data analyst working for a security guard company that has been offered a contract to secure parking lots across Los Angeles. Your goal is to analyze crime data and present visual insights that help the company:
- Identify crime hotspots
- Detect high-risk areas and peak crime hours
- Optimize security guard scheduling and placement
- Enhance safety and operational efficiency

## Key Visualizations
- **Heatmap of Crimes by Hour and Weekday**
- **Crime Distribution Across LA Areas (Map)**
- **Weapons Used – Bubble Chart**
- **Weapon-Related Crimes Across Weekdays – Line Chart**
- **Investigation Outcomes – Pie Chart**
- **Crime Count by Area – Scatter Plot**
- **Crime Type Distribution at Parking Lots – Highlight Table**

## Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of crime patterns across Los Angeles parking lots revealed critical insights into how, when, and where crimes are most likely to occur. These insights empower the security company to take a data-driven approach to guard placement, dynamically allocate personnel to high-risk areas, and deliver tailored, efficient safety solutions.
